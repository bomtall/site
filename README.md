# site

I am a student at London South Bank University and this site was developed as my level 5 Web Technologies Coursework.

The purpose of the site is to show front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

I did not know any JavaScript before starting this project, I learned some as I went along.

I utilised jQuery, D3.js and used AJAX to load the quiz data from a .JSON file.

I am particularly interested in data and I work as a Data Analyst, so I was keen to experiment with some D3.js.

I hope you enjoy taking a look.
